## Features & Differences

Hit chance is no longer random-number-generation-based, but array-based. The gun contains a cylinder, which stores five blanks and one live. If a player is hit,

Special actions called _Skills_ is added to the game, which allows for the player to affect future turns. _Skills_ can be used by consuming _Confidence_, which is gained for each turn.

The game features a dynamic animation and sound system that is supported for animations of every length. Extensive customizability for sprites is also implemented to unlock full creative potential for artists.

A vast number of in-game options are available to customize your preferable playing experience.
